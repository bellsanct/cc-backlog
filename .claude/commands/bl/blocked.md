## Blocker Information

**Blocker Reasons:**
- Extracted from "Blocked Reason" custom field
- Parsed from issue comments (keywords: "blocked", "waiting", "dependency")
- Categorized as internal (issue dependencies) or external (third-party)

**Blocking Issues:**
- Detected from issue links and dependencies
- Shows current status of blocking issue
- Provides direct link to blocking issue

**Duration Tracking:**
- Calculates time since status changed to "Blocked"
- Highlights issues blocked >2 days as critical
- Trends blocked duration for team metrics

**Resolution Suggestions:**
- Escalation paths for long-running blocks
- Alternative tasks to work on during blockage
- Estimated unblock timeline based on blocking issue progress

## Error Handling

**No Project Set:**
```
❌ Error: No project context set
💡 Run /bl:project-set <project_key> first
```

**Invalid Assignee:**
```
❌ Error: User "unknown_user" not found in project
💡 Use /bl:project-info to view project members
```

**API Error:**
```
❌ Error: Unable to fetch blocked issues
💡 Check BacklogMCP connection and try again
```

## Implementation Notes

**BacklogMCP Integration:**
- Uses `get_issue_list` with status filter for "Blocked"
- Queries custom fields for blocker information
- Fetches issue comments for additional context

**Blocker Detection:**
- Primary: Issues with status = "Blocked"
- Secondary: Custom "Blocker Reason" field populated
- Tertiary: Recent comments containing block keywords

**Dependency Analysis:**
- Parses issue links for "blocks" relationship
- Checks parent/child issue dependencies
- Identifies external dependencies from comments

**Duration Calculation:**
- Tracks status history for "Blocked" transitions
- Calculates elapsed time since last block
- Flags issues blocked >48 hours as critical
